          <h4>Greetings!</h4><br>
<!--  FINISH THE TEXT OF THIS SECTION 1/3/22 
          <p>This is Juan, GIS Analyst, ex-archaeologist, and IT trainee.<br> 
            Before entering the IT field, I had a career on Archaeology, spent some time volunteering, and travelling.  <br>
            spent two years on web development projects, getting acquainted with front-end (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Handlebars) and back-end (node, java, PHP, SQL) technologies, which provided me with a general view of the field and a "junior" working capacity. However, no proper job position achieved so far.
            Thus, I also have learned the hard way that my IT thing is analytics, which means that I am now considering to turn to python, R and all the libraries and specific IDEs to handle and visualize data. Moreover, I will need to take a field domain, too (biotech, medical, business, other ???)
            Finally, I did a MSc on GIS last year, so I am competent in using open data (geospatial data, actually), APIs (Google Maps, MapboxGL), and GeoWeb libraries (leaflet.js) to provide geospatial capabilities and data to web and mobile apps. 
            Feel free to look around my profile, and do not hesitate to contact me if anything catches your eye. 
            Best wishes.</p>    -->
          <p>I am a Front-End Developer with a passion on technology. Right now I am focused on learning how to build beautiful websites and useful apps.
            As you can check in the <a class="inline-link" href="experience2.html" ><i>Experience</i></a> section, I recently took a brand new course on my career, and this site
             is an early offspring of my latest efforts. It is a first little step on, we may say!<br>
             Earlier, I can proudly say that I have been an Archaeologist and Researcher for around 20 years.
              Well, and before that I was a musician, said to become a piano performer. Never mind anyway, 
              all these are good old friends to me!<br>
              Here and now I am struggling with coding, debugging, and all the rest to really pull through, reinvent myself again, and enjoy the way as a developer.<br><br>
