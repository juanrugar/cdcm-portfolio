          <h4>Greetings!</h4><br>
          <p>Well, this is me: A GIS Analyst, former Archaeologist, and Front-End developer.<br>
            Four years on, I turned to  Web Development projects, getting acquainted with front-end (HTML,
            CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Handlebars) and some back-end (SQL, MariaDB, MySQL, NodeJS) technologies. These provided me
            with a general new perpective of the GIS field and new possibilities for GIS development. 
            For a "classic" GIS guy, all these new tech and languages, and the web and mobile platforms was overwhelming! 
            However, I did my homework and, step by step, I have been acquiring a new array of tech and skills that comprise 
            the core of my current professional stack.
            Thus, from typical desktop sotware, today I navigate along handling open data sources, APIs, and web
            mapping libraries to provide geospatial capabilities and data to web and mobile apps.

          <p>Before that I have been on the Archaeologist track for about twenty years. My interest on IT tech was
            already there, since Archaeological research moves right behind
            cutting-edge scientific research tech and methods. This is how I ended on Landscape Analysis and GIS in Archaeology.
            From there I got involved with Data Management, Databases and SQL. The resulting profile was a blend of humanistic perspective
            with technological skills focused on spatial-related solutions for research questions. Thanks to that I have
            worked in a number of spatial-related projects,
            both in the academic world, and in engineering and building companies. In sum, I can proudly say that I had
            a rich and productive career, crowned by a PhD in
            Archaeology.

            But times change and GIS career evolved accordingly. Traditional GIS had its appeal, but reality nowadays is that 
            tech is everywhere and new programs, procedures, workflows are the mainstream trunk of Geospatial Sciences: 
            APIs, Sotfware Libraries, Web and Mobile Development, IDE sources, and a long etc, are now the working ground 
            for GIS professionals, and my everyday ecosystem. 
            <br>
